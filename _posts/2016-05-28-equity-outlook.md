Equity Outlook

SEO will play a major role in driving numbers upwards. The aim will be to create a

big 

keyword database with multiple query combinations and let the performance metrics dictate where to allocate resources. Need to go through all of the target search verticals, as dictated by the chosen go-to-market categories. The next step is to identify the top 100 highest search volume terms within those verticals and scrape the top 100 URLs that are currently ranking. From here we begin an exhaustive process of evaluating the opportunities for each keyword, and then aggregate opportunities to discern which categories we need to focus on to grow traffic. Essentially we need to target the low-hanging fruit; keywords identified by our model that could generate a minimum level of traffic in 3 months or less, with a minimum investment in content development. As soon as we receive new content, we focus additional

keyword research on finding concepts and phrases that are both complimentary and contextually relevant. 

A Traffic Acquisition Strategy will be developed prior to
launch.
